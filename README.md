# password-generator-js-challenge
Password generator for our bootcamp challenge 3. 

## Description
This challenge is to utilize Javascript to build a web prompt criteria list for generating a randomize password. Original HTML and CSS was provided to me and the focus was on the Javascript. 

I performed a javascript that prompts and confirms the criterias request for generating a passssword. Though I have the console log confirming that my logic is going well, I still need to continue to work on this and concate the multiple iterations of the function I placed on my javascript and will need to continue to work my educators.
